# About Data for Black Lives
[Data for Black Lives](https://d4bl.org/about.html) (D4BL) is a movement of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people. Since the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.

## 1. [Impact of COVID-19 on Black Communities Map Project](https://github.com/github/SI-skills-based-volunteering/issues/20)- Established maturity level project
D4BL has worked to consolidate state level data to explore the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black people in the US. The D4BL COVID-19 Dataset captures state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths for Black people in the United States. The primary objective of the map is to be a source of education for our network so that people are continually aware of the racial disparities within each state's COVID data. After that, we hope to engage in more data storytelling to provide a more complete picture of what's happening in these states.
