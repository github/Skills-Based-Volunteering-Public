## 1. Planet 4 [Accesility Updates](https://github.com/github/SI-skills-based-volunteering/issues/8)- Established maturity level project
Planet 4 is a content management system and engagement platform used by Greenpeace to engage with supporters and win campaigns around the world. It is built on top of Wordpress and has many features that make it a powerful tool for campaigning, engaging and recruiting supporters and volunteers, and amplifying our work.

Out of this audit Greenpeace has created issues to help provide a more inclusive platform.
