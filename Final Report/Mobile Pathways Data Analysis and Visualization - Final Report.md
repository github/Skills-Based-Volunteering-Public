Mobile Pathways helps immigrants gain access to reliable legal information about their numerous pathways to immigration via mobile phone technology.

We partner with immigration-based nonprofits and attorneys to reach the vast and diverse population of intending immigrants.

This project will help Mobile Pathways understand where they should focus their funding on and a breakdown of the demographics of their rights-holders. 

### Partner Organization Project
Mobile Pathways has collected data from a statewide survey however there are gaps in the data from the survey. This partner organization wants to know what is statistically relevant from the 800 000 data points they have collected.

Output: Analyze the data captured from a state-wide survey and create visualization that can be used for presentations to help illustrate how emergency funds have helped the community and this analysis will also help Mobile Pathways secure non profit funding in the future.
