# Manager's Toolkit for Reviewing Manager Acknowledgement requests #

## What is Skills Based Volunteering? ##

Skills based volunteering are opportunities where Hubbers can help provide solutions to complex business and technical problems for social sector organizations (including the United Nations and NGOs) that are solving the world's biggest social issues. Skills based volunteering can help Hubbers hone and perfect a skill, help provide capacity to impactful social organizations, and assist organizations accomplish their mission in making the world a better place.

## What happens when a direct report on my team wants to join a SBV project? ## 

The Social Impact team and the volunteer Hubber will contact each Manager with the project details of how long the project will run and how many hours it will take.
Here are some topics to discuss with your direct report:
- What skills will you gain from the Skills Based Volunteering Project?
- How can this project contribute to your team?
- What are some ways this project can accelerate your career goals?

## What if the Hubber is under performance review? ##

For Hubber’s under a performance review it will be up to the Manager’s discretion to approve or reject the project request.
Social Impact will be working with HR to help provide support as required.

## I have a Hubber on my team that wants to gain some leadership experience, how do I nominate a Hubber to a SBV project? ##
Reach out to @csmlo for details on upcoming projects where a Hubber can lead a project team!

## What if I cannot approve a Hubber’s request to join a SBV project? ##
We encourage open communication and can help redirect Hubbers to alternate avenues of social impact such as Benevity.

Once a Hubber is approved for a project:
