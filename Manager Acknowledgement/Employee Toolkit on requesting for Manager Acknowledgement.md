# Employee Volunteer Toolkit for Requesting Manager Acknowledgement 
## What is Skills Based Volunteering?

Skills based volunteering are opportunities where employees can help provide solutions to complex business and technical problems for social sector organizations (including the United Nations and NGOs) that are solving the world's biggest social issues. Skills based volunteering can help employees hone and perfect a skill, help provide capacity to impactful social organizations, and assist organizations accomplish their mission in making the world a better place. We aim to match skilled Hubbers with partner social sector organizations to help solve their strategic and technical problems through short term projects.

## What should I explain to my Manager I want to join a SBV project?
Here are some items to think about before you chat with Manager:
- How can this project help my team?
- What skills will I gain that can help my team?

The Social Impact team will help connect with your Manager to clarify the project’s set number of hours, duration and how you will make an impact.
